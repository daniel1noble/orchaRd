\title{Add Ghost Points to Orchard Plot}
\usage{
.add_ghost_points(model, group, transfm)
}
\arguments{
\item{model}{A meta-analytic model object from the \pkg{metafor} package.}

\item{group}{Character string specifying the column name in \code{model$data} that
identifies the grouping variable. Each unique value in this variable is omitted in turn.}

\item{transfm}{Character string with the transformation to be applied}
}
\value{
A \pkg{ggplot2} layer (via \code{geom_quasirandom}) displaying the ghost points.
}
\description{
Internal function to add ghost points to an orchard plot.
}
\details{
Ghost points represent the effect sizes that were omitted in each leave-one-out iteration.
They are plotted as empty points with reduced opacity to indicate their auxiliary role.


The function extracts the removed points from the original model's data, converts the grouping
variable to a factor, and computes a scaling factor (the inverse square root of the variance)
for the point sizes.
