\title{Fit Meta-Analytic Models While Omitting Each Group}
\usage{
run_leave1out(model, group, vcalc_args = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{model}{A fitted model object containing a \code{data} element, which must be 
a data frame with all model variables.}

\item{group}{A character string specifying the column in \code{model$data} that 
defines the groups to be omitted one at a time.}
}
\value{
A named list of models, each fitted after omitting one group. Names correspond 
  to the omitted group IDs.
}
\description{
Iteratively refits a meta-analytic model, leaving out one level of a specified 
grouping variable in each iteration.
}
\details{
The function removes each unique group from \code{model$data} one at a time, 
  refitting the model using \code{update()}. If an update fails, a warning is issued, 
  and \code{NULL} is returned for that group.
